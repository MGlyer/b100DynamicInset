	                  <p> <strong>Rap has become</strong> the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-pop-diva-identity-crisis-1508348017" class="icon none">most-consumed music in America</a>, according to industry data, but with its growth comes a new concern: a widening generation gap.</p>
	                  <div class="paywall">
	                     <p>Just as rock ‘n‘ roll splintered in the 1970s when punk arrived, a beef between some young hip-hop artists and “dad rappers” is dividing fans. Some music insiders worry that the schism will hurt the unity of the hip-hop community when its music is at its cultural and commercial peak by splitting fans into opposing camps.</p>
	                     <p>“Hip-hop is a culture, and all cultures, without exception, have traditions and norms,” says
	                        Tuma Basa,
	                        <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-music-industrys-new-gatekeepers-1510761601" class="icon none">Spotify’s global head of hip-hop</a>. “It can stop being a culture if some of its traditions and heritage is not—forget about acknowledged—even known.”

											 </div>
	                     <p>On one side are upstarts whose raw, genre-hopping music has been labeled “emo rap.” On the other are elder statesmen like Jay-Z, who cater to older fans in a youth-obsessed genre. Bridging the divide? Thirty-something stars like <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-case-for-kendrick-lamar-1503140436" class="icon none">Kendrick Lamar</a> and
	                        Nicki Minaj.
	                     </p>
	                     <p>Below are five things to know about rap’s generation gap.</p>
	                     <h6>Hip-Hop’s New Wave Is Emerging</h6>
	                     <p>Rappers like Future and Migos, whose mumbling delivery drew both attention and criticism a few years ago, have achieved mainstream success. The new generation—particularly those in Florida’s underground scene and on the streaming platform SoundCloud—diverge even more from traditional styles.</p>
	                     <p>They meld hip-hop with diarylike lyrics, lo-fi production values and indie-rock influences, evoking “emo,” the angst-ridden rock genre popular in the early 2000s. On his debut studio album “17,” for example, Florida rapper XXXTentacion, 19, often sings; there are moody, atmospheric guitars and pianos, and song titles like “Depression &amp; Obsession” and “Revenge.” The 20-minute album peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard chart <a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/xxxtentacion-17/" target="_blank" class="icon none">but received</a> <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=cmYXxJs0uCk" target="_blank" class="icon none">mixed reviews</a>. (XXXTentacion, one of rap’s most controversial figures, faces charges related to an alleged domestic-abuse incident in Florida. He has pleaded not guilty.)</p>
	                     <p>The gloomy lyrics and unpolished attack of acts like his and Philadelphia rapper
	                        Lil Uzi Vert,
	                        who racked up 3.5 billion on-demand streams last year, according to Nielsen Music, seem like a natural progression from Atlanta heavyweights like Future, says cultural critic
	                        Hanif Abdurraqib.
	                        “It feels like it’s going to stick around.”
	                     </p>
	                     <h6>Rap’s Growth, Technology Fuel the Divide</h6>
	                     <p>Back in the 1990s, rock music expanded by absorbing elements of rap, spawning groups like Rage Against the Machine and Korn. Now the reverse is happening: Rap is incorporating rock, having already annexed R&amp;B and pop music.</p>
	                     <p>“Every genre that used to exist in music, exist[s] in hip-hop,” says
	                        David Jacobs,
	                        a music-industry lawyer. Emerging artists who might have once tried to be rock stars “are becoming rappers,” Mr. Jacobs says.
	                     </p>
	                     <p>Streaming services and social media are also fueling this expansion. Up-and-coming rappers used to rely heavily on the sponsorship, or “cosign,” of veteran rappers. (
	                        Dr. Dre’s
	                        Aftermath Entertainment label in 1998 signed Eminem, for example.) Today, artists like Ski Mask The Slump God can amass an audience on their own.
	                     </p>
	                     <p>Fledgling hip-hop acts were previously dependent on traditional gatekeepers to help them get their music out, says
	                        Steven Victor,
	                        executive vice president and head of A&amp;R at Def Jam Recordings, who signed Ski Mask to Victor Victor Worldwide, his personal label, a joint venture with Universal Music Group. “With the internet and streaming, it doesn’t matter.”
	                     </p>
	                     <p></p>
	                     <h6>Upstarts Give Their Elders the Finger</h6>
	                     <p>Hip-hop has experienced many divisive moments over the decades, but today’s young rappers are making headlines by taunting the establishment.</p>
	                     <p>In 2016,
	                        Lil Yachty,
	                        now 20, <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/69673-lil-yachty-calls-the-notorious-big-overrated/" target="_blank" class="icon none">told the website Pitchfork</a> that the legendary rapper Biggie Smalls, aka the Notorious B.I.G., was “overrated.” (He later apologized.) Lil Pump, a 17-year-old Florida rapper, has a song titled “F**k
	                        J. Cole,
	                        ” referring to the thirty-something rapper. J. Cole’s representative didn’t respond to a request for comment.
	                     </p>
	                     <p>Atlanta’s 21 Savage, 25, has criticized older “O.G. rappers” for scapegoating the new generation. “They say we make drug-user music,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/21savage/status/933056041562013697" target="_blank" class="icon none">wrote in November</a>. “Like making drug-selling music is better.”</p>
	                     <p>Experts say young rappers are simply “trolling” their elders for fun or publicity. But Mr. Abdurraqib says he is worried about the potential damage to the hip-hop community’s sense of history and lineage. Droves of rock fans have listened to Led Zeppelin over the decades. What if teen rap artists and fans aren’t curious about Biggie? </p>
	                     <p>If rap’s generations go their own ways and disregard each other’s music, as some observers fear, that could also dent album and concert-ticket sales.</p>
	                     <p>In rock, for example, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/twilight-of-the-rock-gods-1490439609" class="icon none">nostalgia is a moneymaker</a>. The five highest-grossing concert tours in history have occurred in roughly the last decade: U2, the Rolling Stones, Coldplay, Guns N’ Roses and
	                        Roger Waters,
	                        according to Billboard. Hip-hop’s nostalgia business—“classic rap”—remains a relative laggard.
